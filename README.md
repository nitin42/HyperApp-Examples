# HyperApp examples

This is the source for HyperApp examples. You can find examples in [`examples`](./examples) directory.

## Running Examples

```
git clone https://www.github.com/nitin42/HyperApp-Examples
cd HyperApp-Examples
npm install
```

Then in `index.js`, uncomment any of `exports` to run the example. After you uncomment one,

```
npm run build
```

and after generating the `bundle.js`

```
npm run start
```

I'll be adding more examples soon !ðŸ˜„
